"DO IT" is a fitness application I developed in 2015. It has been tested on Android devices.


Features:
- track your runs including route taken on the map, using Google Maps API
- store your run data, including time taken, distance traveled, average pace, calories burnt and map data.
- manage and sort your run data on a table
